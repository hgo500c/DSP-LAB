1) Use Matlab to implement the Overlap-Add Convolution Algorithm for the following input signal and impulse response.

audio_recording_8kHz.wav   (INPUT SIGNAL)

impulse_response_8kHz.wav   (IMPULSE RESPONSE)

output_8kHz.wav  (OUTPUT SIGNAL)

In your overlap-add convolution algorithm, the convolution should be computed using the FFT. I suggest using a block length of 4096.

The data is located in the file 'acoustic impulse response.zip'

The Overlap-Add Convolution Algorithm is described in the pdf file 'overlap block conv.pdf'

You should verify that your overlap-add algorithm gives the same result as the Matlab 'conv' function. 

This impulse response data is adapted from data on the 'OpenAIR â€“ Open Air Library' Website: https://www.openair.hosted.york.ac.uk

2) Use Python to do the above exercise.
